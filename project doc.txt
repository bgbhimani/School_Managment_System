🧠 API Structure Recommendation
Organize routers like this:
routers/
    auth.py
    admin.py
    teacher.py
    student.py
    notice.py
    attendance.py
    test.py
Then protect them using:
@router.post("/create-teacher")
def create_teacher(
    data: TeacherCreate,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_admin)
)

🔐 Role Guard Plan
You should create:
get_current_user()
get_current_admin()
get_current_teacher()
get_current_student()
So your endpoints become clean and secure.

💡 Suggested Method Naming Convention
For Admin:
create_teacher()
update_student()
assign_teacher_to_class()

For Teacher:
create_attendance()
add_test_marks()
create_notice()

view_my_results()
